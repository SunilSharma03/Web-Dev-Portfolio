  const foundingStory = `In 2019, our founders experienced the frustration of endless scrolling through generic accommodation listings that told them nothing about the actual experience of staying there. After booking what seemed like a perfect beachfront villa only to discover it was next to a construction site, they realized the travel industry needed a fundamental shift from quantity to quality, from booking to belonging.

The insight was simple yet profound: where you stay doesn't just provide shelterâ€”it shapes your entire travel experience. A thoughtfully chosen accommodation becomes the lens through which you experience a destination, connecting you with local culture, hidden gems, and authentic moments that transform a trip into a story worth telling.

StayFinder was born from this realization, with a mission to bridge the gap between wanderlust and belonging. We believe every traveler deserves to find their perfect temporary home, whether it's a minimalist loft in Tokyo that connects them with the city's design culture, a family-run riad in Marrakech that offers authentic Moroccan hospitality, or a sustainable treehouse in Costa Rica that deepens their connection with nature.`;
