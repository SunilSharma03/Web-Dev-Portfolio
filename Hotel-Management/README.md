### Animation Suggestions

1. **Demo Animation**: 
   - Create a GIF that showcases the main features of your Java application. This could include the booking process, managing guest information, and generating reports.
   - Use tools like **LICEcap**, **ScreenToGif**, or **OBS Studio** to record your screen and create GIFs.

2. **Feature Highlights**:
   - Use animated icons or illustrations to represent different features of your system. Websites like **LottieFiles** offer lightweight animations that can be embedded in your README.

3. **Installation Steps**:
   - Consider creating a short animated GIF that visually guides users through the installation process. This could show the terminal commands being executed or the application starting up.

### Tips for Creating Animations

- **Keep it Short**: Aim for a duration of 5-10 seconds for GIFs to maintain viewer engagement.
- **Optimize File Size**: Use tools like **EZGIF** or **GIPHY** to compress your GIFs without losing quality.
- **Clear Labels**: Add captions or labels to your animations to explain what the viewer is seeing.
